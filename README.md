# SvelteKit Markdown Site

This is supposed to be a simple static site tool with a bunch of opinions:

* [sveltekit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)
* mardown for content pages via [mdsvex](https://mdsvex.com/)
* [Carbon components for Svelte](https://carbon-components-svelte.onrender.com/) as the UI components library, although you could use anything here.
